Elbow is a library for extracting data from a bunch of files and loading into a table (and that's it).

## Examples

```python
import json

import pandas as pd
from elbow import build_table, build_parquet

# Extract records from JSON-lines
def extract(path):
    with open(path) as f:
        for line in f:
            record = json.loads(line)
            yield record

# Load as a pandas dataframe
df = build_table(
    source="**/*.json",
    extract=extract,
)

# Load as a parquet dataset (in parallel)
build_parquet(
    source="**/*.json",
    extract=extract,
    where="dset.pqds/",
    workers=8,
)

df = pd.read_parquet("dset.pqds")
```

## Installation

A pre-release version can be installed with
